# SQL-Project

## Overview
The **SQL Capstone Project** focuses on analyzing airline data using SQL queries. This project involves retrieving, transforming, and analyzing data from the **Airline DB** to extract insights related to bookings, flights, passengers, and airport operations.

## Project Motivation
Airline databases store vast amounts of information on flights, passengers, and operations. This project demonstrates the ability to query and manipulate such data to answer business-critical questions, such as identifying the busiest airports, highest-paying passengers, flight schedules, and cancellations.

## Features
- **Data Retrieval & Formatting:** Extracting and transforming flight and booking details.
- **Passenger Insights:** Identifying highest and lowest paying customers.
- **Operational Analytics:** Analyzing flights, cancellations, seat allocations, and airport traffic.
- **Aggregations & Ranking:** Using SQL functions like `RANK()`, `COUNT()`, and `SUM()` to derive meaningful insights.
- **Joins & Subqueries:** Combining data from multiple tables to generate comprehensive reports.

## Data Sources
- **Database:** Airline DB
- **Tables Used:**
  - `Bookings`
  - `Flights`
  - `Tickets`
  - `Boarding_Passes`
  - `Seats`
  - `Aircrafts`
  - `Airports`
- **Query Playground:** [Skillovilla SQL Playground](https://www.skillovilla.com/playground/sql?exerciseId=0181e251-6ea8-4595-ae2b-0c690119f8db)

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (PostgreSQL syntax)**
